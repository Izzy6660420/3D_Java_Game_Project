# 3D Java Game Project

## What is the purpose of this project?

As the name of the repository suggests, the ultimate goal of this project would be to develop a game, of my idea, from a 3D Game Engine programmed entirely in the Java language within Eclipse. This in turn helps me polish my Java coding skill and lets me learn new things whilst fulfilling my dream and aspiration of making a game that I am proud to call my own some day.

## Learning Goals
- **Capable & Replicable**: Be capable of writing similar code/program at the end and replicate the same engine when developing different games.
- **Refresh**: Learning should not stop after university, coding this engine and subsequently coding a game in Java can refresh and jog my memories on things I have learned back when I was still an undergraduate.
- **Trials and Errors**: There will be plenty of bugs and obstacles I will run into during the development of this project, learn from them and minimize them in the future.

## Libraries Used

This project is only possible because of the hard work put into these foundational technologies:

- [LWJGL3](https://www.lwjgl.org): A Java library that enables cross-platform access to popular native APIs useful in the development of graphics(*OpenGL*, *Vulkan*), audio(*OpenAL*) and parallel computing (*OpenCL*) applications.
- [Dear ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui): designed to enable fast iterations and to empower programmers to create content creation tools and visualizaton/debug tools.

## Tools Used

A list of tools utilized to not only develop the 3D Engine and game itself, but also to keep track of my goals for the project and to keep up a habit of developing this project so I don't procrastinate it.

- Eclipse: Utilized to do most of my coding and development for the project itself.
- GitHub: Keep track of my current progress on the project and to commit my daily/weekly progress onto a cloud-based service so I won't lose my code.
- Visual Studio Code: To write down and update my progress tab and to write any markdown files in general as there are extensions that allows me to preview what's uploaded onto GitHub before I fully commit them
- Notion/Trello: To have a board that keeps track of my current and future goals for the project and to keep me in tuned with my habits.

## Thanks and Resources

This project will be entirely impossible without the invaluable resources provided by these creators. Therefore I will have a section dedicated towards thanking these people.

- [Antonio Hernandez Bejarano](https://github.com/lwjglgamedev): The main resource for this entire project, by following the book that he's written surrounding [3D Development with LWJGL3](https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/lwjglbook-bookcontents/tree/main).
- [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/@ThinMatrix/featured): By cross-referencing with his [OpenGL 3D Game Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8wlS9hF8E&list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP&pp=iAQB) playlist.
